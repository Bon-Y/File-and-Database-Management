Tweet Data Management and Analysis System

# Python and SQLite3-based Tweet Database

In the first phase of the project, We designed and implemented a Python application integrated with the SQLite3 database system. This component served as a tweet data repository, efficiently storing and managing both user and tweet information. The main functionalities of this program included:

User Management: Creation, modification, and deletion of user profiles, capturing details such as username, profile information, and follower/following relationships.

Tweet Management: Storing tweets with metadata such as timestamps, likes, and retweets. Additionally, this system enabled the retrieval of tweets associated with specific users or hashtags.

Data Integrity: Ensuring the integrity of the database by handling data validation and consistency checks.

# Python and MongoDB-based Tweet Data Loader and Indexer

In the second phase, We developed a Python application that leveraged MongoDB to efficiently handle large JSON datasets of tweets. This program offered the capability to ingest extensive tweet data and create a structured database in MongoDB. The primary functionalities included:

Data Loading: Parsing JSON-formatted tweet data and inserting it into a MongoDB collection, ensuring efficient data ingestion.

Indexing and Search: Creating indexes for fast retrieval and enabling users to perform searches based on various criteria, such as keywords, hashtags, and user mentions.

Scalability: Designing the system to handle large volumes of tweet data, making it suitable for applications requiring real-time or historical data analysis.
